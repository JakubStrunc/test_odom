# test_odom


 I start to work on my odometry by using paralel and vertical encoder and Imu. 

What I did it:

- made the fuction, which caltulate the local X and Y position(the distance in one arc). 



What I want to do next time:

- calculate the total (current) X and Y position with using the angle of the robot.
- rewrite this function into the multitasked code
