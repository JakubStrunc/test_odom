# test_odom


 I start to work on my odometry by using paralel and vertical encoder and Imu. 



Today, I made the fuction, which caltulate the local X and Y position(the distance in one arc). I use the Team 5225A, the E-Bots PiLons, pdf document for learn (https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/software/odometry). I works pretty well.



For the next time, I want to figure out, how to calculate the total (current) X and Y position with using the angle of the robot.Next, I want to rewrite this code into the code because it is lagging as it is long
